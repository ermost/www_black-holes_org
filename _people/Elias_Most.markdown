##### Research Projects

As a computational and theoretical astrophysicist I am interested in the physics of compact objects, such as neutron stars and black holes.  
Recent areas of interest include various aspects of binary neutron star mergers (gravitational waves and equation of state effects, quark and exotic matter, neutrino-driven bulk viscosity, dynamo and jet physics), high-energy astrophysical transients (radio, X-ray and gamma-ray emission from flares and shocks in compact binary mergers), as well as fundamental aspects of relativistic fluid dynamics (multi-fluids and non-ideal dissipative effects).  
Recently, I have also become interested in accretion physics in the context of supermassive binary black hole mergers.


##### Biography

I am an Assistant Professor of Theoretical Astrophysics at Caltech. Before moving to California, I was the John Archibald Wheeler Postdoctoral Fellow at Princeton University and a Long-Term Member at the Institute for Advanced Study. I received my PhD from the Goethe University Frankfurt (Germany), and was a predoctoral fellow at the Flatiron Institute in New York.
